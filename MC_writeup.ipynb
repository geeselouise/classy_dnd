    "All character sheet data was obtained from GitHub user [oganm's](https://github.com/oganm) repository [dnddata](https://github.com/oganm/dnddata). It is a weekly updated dataset of characters that are submitted to his web applications [printSheetApp](https://oganm.com/shiny/printSheetApp/) and [interactiveSheet](https://oganm.com/shiny/interactiveSheet/). He did some exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to determine rarity of DnD characters in a [dndstats blogpost](https://oganm.github.io/dndstats/). This was based on an article by FiveThirtyEight titled: [Is Your D&D Character Rare?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-your-dd-character-rare/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**dataset**](https://github.com/oganm/dnddata/blob/master/data-raw/dnd_chars_all.tsv) has 9784 character sheets, with about 19 features. Some of them Oganm processed which was nice. Many had to be one-hot encoded and categorized to feed into the model."
